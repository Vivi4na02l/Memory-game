The code I put on CSS flips the cards but it seems that the code can't execute different actions to the same events in two diferent "languages", which means, if I activate the code in the
CSS my javascript code won't work properly


Probably it isn't working because I change the innerHTML of the "div" when there's a click event (so after not being able to figure out a solution by myself, i went to the internet and
realized that most memory games would have two pictures at the same time instead of changing the innerHTML like me, which is probably why my isn't working to flip)
